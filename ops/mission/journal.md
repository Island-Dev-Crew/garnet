# Mission Journal — Garnet S114 Closure & Hardening

Append-only session log, newest entry LAST.

## 2026-07-12T21:30Z — session 1 (kickoff)

- Mission bootstrapped from the S114 Plan of Attack (Desktop HTML, 2026-07-12) at HEAD d0d4f7c; orchestration Tier 1 (Workflow tool available, ultracode session).
- 9-agent recon workflow grounded every phase in file:line anchors; digest in session scratchpad; the load-bearing findings are recorded in state.json task notes.
- Two recovered-evidence discoveries: the S114 Windows lane-2 review bundle (commit 6153726, 160-file manifest) and the Codex verdict commit (61cfbae) exist as unreachable objects in C:/garnet and as reachable refs in the nested Desktop repo (branch validation/2026-06-25-codex-s114-review, also on the Navigata1 fork). Protective local refs created: s114/recovered-lane2-review, s114/recovered-codex-verdict (P1-T1 done).
- Confirmed the promo-line machine dependence: this machine renders composition-ready (50.0%) vs committed public-site-embedded (95.0%); only ledger line 84 differs. P0 includes the canonical-snapshot fix.
- gh auth switched Navigata1 -> IslandDevCrew (admin verified). No branch protection on main (verified via API) — green-before-merge is discipline.
- Authorization basis for this mission recorded: Jon's written directive of 2026-07-12 ("execute everything end to end in its completion") over the plan document; S114 acceptance provenance will cite it verbatim. CI-wiring merges remain Jon-only.
- Mission bootstrap merged as #472 (4168582), full CI green (26 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail).

## 2026-07-13T03:20Z — session 1 (Phase 0 complete)

- P0-T1: authored S114 acceptance artifact — LAUNCH/S114_ACCEPTANCE.json (schema garnet.s114_acceptance/v1, state accepted-scoped, scope "first-party CLI/Wasm trust-kernel baseline") + W_TRUST/S114_ACCEPTANCE_RECORD_2026-07-12.md. Provenance explicit: decided by Jon, basis = his execute-end-to-end directive; independence_relabel=false — the S114 verdict language stays "independently-re-verified-with-fixes". Five conditions map to P1/P2/P3; out_of_scope + tracked_debt recorded.
- P0-T2: reporter now READS the artifact (never grades): read_s114_acceptance() -> accepted-scoped, fail-closed to external-pending on missing/malformed. launch_ready membership accepts accepted-scoped for the s114 slot but stays False (playground/wasm/shelf open) — accepting S114 makes no launch claim. Added read_promo_snapshot() + committed PROMO_EVIDENCE_SNAPSHOT.json so ledger regeneration is machine-independent (fixes the PR #466 machine-dependent-promo flag); live probe still invoked. Regenerated LAUNCH_READINESS.md — diff was exactly the S114 section, promo line held at 95.0%.
- Gates: P0-G1 reporter suite 37/37 OK (Windows needs PYTHONUTF8=1 — pin test captures child stdout, cp1252 mangles em-dashes; locale artifact, not content; suite is not in CI). P0-G2 evidence integrity 36/36 ok. Reporter --gate still exits 1 (HOLD) as it must.
- Next: P1-T2 land the recovered Codex verdict + Windows lane-2 review bundles under proofs/ (refs already protected).
