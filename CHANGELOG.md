# Changelog

All notable changes to Garnet are recorded here.

Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This file is updated in the same PR as the work it tracks (per the v0.5 slice
contract). Lines added here are part of the calibrated-honesty record — if a
slice ships labeled "partial," its CHANGELOG entry says so explicitly.

## [Unreleased] — v0.5.0 in flight

### Added

- **S8 (Signed hot-reload BLAKE3 demo):** `examples/mvp_11_signed_hotreload.garnet`
  and `examples/mvp_11_signed_hotreload_mismatch.garnet` are runnable
  managed-mode demonstrations of the BLAKE3 fingerprint check that drives the
  Rust-runtime `actor.reload_signed` path. The success example exits 0 with
  `reloaded successfully` on stdout; the mismatch example exits 1 with
  `BLAKE3 fingerprint mismatch` on stderr. New "Signed hot-reload BLAKE3 demo"
  lane in `garnet_mit_readiness_status.py` (verified 100%). Honest deferred
  list documents that managed-mode `actor.reload_signed` syntax is NOT
  exposed yet — the demos use `crypto::blake3` and `raise` to reproduce the
  fingerprint-mismatch behaviour at the program level. Closes Paper VI
  Contribution 5 surface gap.
- **S10 (Compiler advisory mode, rules-based):** `garnet-check-v0.3/src/suggest.rs`
  ships a deterministic, no-LLM suggestion engine with three rules today —
  `managed-fn-missing-caps`, `long-parameter-list`, and `empty-function-body`.
  `garnet check --suggest <file.garnet>` surfaces them prefixed with the
  literal `compiler suggested:` so downstream tooling can grep. Corpus test
  `garnet-check-v0.3/tests/suggest_corpus.rs` proves ≥ 3 distinct rules fire on
  3 fixture programs. New "Compiler advisory mode (rules-based)" lane in
  `garnet_mit_readiness_status.py` (verified 100%). Closes Paper VI
  Contribution 7 surface for the rules-based tier; the LLM tier remains
  pending-infra.
- **S5 (Parser fuzz harness):** `garnet-parser-v0.3/fuzz/` cargo-fuzz
  sub-workspace with a single `parse_input` target wrapping every call to
  `garnet_parser::parse_source_with_budget` in a strict `ParseBudget`
  (4096-byte source cap, 1024-token cap, 32-depth cap, 512-byte literal
  cap). New `.github/workflows/fuzz-nightly.yml` runs `cargo +nightly
  fuzz run parse_input -- -max_total_time=3600` nightly + on-demand;
  crashes upload as artifacts for triage. Seed corpus is populated from
  canonical `examples/*.garnet` files. New "Parser fuzz harness
  (nightly)" lane in `garnet_mit_readiness_status.py` (`verified` 100%).
  `scripts/garnet_proof_benchmark_status.py` also inventories the fuzz
  harness as evidence while keeping accumulated nightly fuzz hours unclaimed.
  The fuzz sub-workspace carries explicit license metadata and a scoped
  `cargo deny --manifest-path garnet-parser-v0.3/fuzz/Cargo.toml check`
  record for `libfuzzer-sys`'s permissive NCSA component. Honest deferred list
  documents that the interpreter, checker, and archived v0.2 parser are NOT in
  scope today.
- **S9 (Determinism CI):** `.github/workflows/determinism.yml` builds
  `examples/det_fixture_01.garnet` with `garnet build --deterministic --sign
  <key>` on a matrix of ubuntu-latest and macos-latest. A `prepare-key` job
  generates a single short-lived ed25519 signing key and uploads it as an
  artifact so both OSs sign with identical key bytes; the `compare` job
  diffs the resulting per-OS SHA-256 manifest hashes and fails CI with an
  `::error::` annotation on divergence. Closes Paper VI Contribution 6
  verification gap. New "Determinism CI cross-machine" lane in
  `garnet_mit_readiness_status.py` (`verified` 100%); honest deferred list
  documents that Windows runner and Linux aarch64 are not yet in the
  cross-OS matrix.
- **S0 (housekeeping):** `scripts/garnet_conformance_matrix_check.py` — file-existence
  check on the conformance matrix's evidence column. Advisory by default; `--strict`
  opts into CI-fail behavior. Lands the gate before the existing matrix shorthand
  is repaired so future drift is catchable.
- **S0 (housekeeping):** `--check-no-regression` flag on
  `scripts/garnet_mit_readiness_status.py`. Compares live lane percentages against
  a committed baseline at
  `F_Project_Management/GARNET_v0_5_READINESS_BASELINE.json` and exits 1 on any
  drop. Lanes absent from the live output (slice removed/renamed) also trigger
  failure.
- **S0 (housekeeping):** baseline snapshot
  `F_Project_Management/GARNET_v0_5_READINESS_BASELINE.json` captured at
  54.2 % overall / 12 lanes from the 2026-05-20 main tip.
- **v0.5 slice contract:** `F_Project_Management/GARNET_v0_5_SLICE_DOGFOOD.md` —
  single source of truth for every v0.5 PR. State machine, dogfood blocks,
  honesty anchors, PR template.
- **S1 (LSP MVP):** source-present `garnet-lsp/` language server and
  `editors/vscode/` extension launcher for diagnostics, hover, and basic
  go-to-definition. `scripts/smoke_garnet_lsp_protocol.py` proves those paths
  over stdio; local VSIX packaging and install smoke passed on this Mac/Cursor
  profile.
- **S2 (Bytecode VM scaffold):** source-present `garnet-vm/` crate with a
  deterministic bytecode serializer, 15 native opcode families, function-level
  tree-walk fallback, `garnet run --vm` / `--interp` dispatch, a bounded
  Criterion VM/interpreter comparison harness, and
  `C_Language_Specification/GARNET_BYTECODE_v0_1.md`. The proof/benchmark
  reporter now inventories the VM harness, and the MIT reporter's proof lane is
  more granular while the overall objective remains 58.1%.

### Honest partials

- Release-candidate preflight retargets the canonical workspace/CLI version and
  installer defaults to `0.5.0`, but it is not a tag and not proof that release
  assets or a published VSIX exist. The latest tagged release remains `v0.4.2`
  until the clean-machine public installer and editor-extension gate is
  recorded.
- The S1 LSP slice is source-present until published-extension evidence and
  full manual VSCode hover/go-to-definition screenshots are attached to later
  review/release evidence. Safe-mode hover, workspace symbols, rename, and
  CST-grade incremental precision remain deferred.
- The S2 VM is a scaffold, not a production VM. It covers 15 opcode families for
  the MVP fixtures, falls back to the tree-walk interpreter at unsupported
  function boundaries, and does not claim a stable bytecode ABI, production
  native compiler proof, full safe-mode lowering, or standing benchmark
  measurements in the status reporter.
- The S5 fuzz harness is source-present with local 60-second dogfood evidence
  and scheduled nightly coverage, not a claim that one-hour nightly fuzz has
  already accumulated or that parser correctness is proven.

### Known Advisory Gates (inherited, not yet fixed)

- Conformance matrix shorthand: 9 path-like references in
  `C_Language_Specification/GARNET_v0_4_2_Conformance_Matrix.md` do not resolve
  to files on disk today. The new check surfaces these as advisory findings; a
  future slice will fix the matrix and flip the gate to strict.

## Historical record

For the v0.4.2 (research-grade) verification ledger and earlier phase logs, see
`F_Project_Management/GARNET_v4_2_HANDOFF.md` and the dated `GARNET_v*_HANDOFF`
files. Pre-CHANGELOG history was tracked in those handoff documents; from v0.5
onward this file is the canonical entry point.
